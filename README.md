# SW Character Handbook

## Installation and Run

1. Clone
2. cd to star-wars
3. npm i
4. npm start

## The Interpretation of the Task

You mention that you need to find out which character belongs in which film(s). While the suggestion was to display films first, I went the other way, you can search for character (or see 10 popular ones), then click on him/her/it to display the info and the films they're in.

This obviously could be reversed to search for films and then open the info. Or have both..? Depends on the needs of a Star Wars fan. Right now it's a quick character look-up solution, with subpages for characters.

## Solving THE PROBLEM

I really wanted to solve, finish the multiple endpoint receipt and render problem via JS Promises on a forEach loop, managed. Thanks for all the creative suggestions they were great as well. (See pages/Character.jsx, line 17)

## The tools

    - create-react-app
    - react-router-dom
    - node-sass

## Improvements

Obviously, it's perfect. But if I had to change something, maybe I would add pagination to ALL characters filter. Different section for films, more info about the character/film.

The API does not contain images, would be cool. Codewise, hopefully you can give me some insights into readability, thats the main thing, is it understandable for a fellow human?

Design-wise, it's very minimalistic, maybe would do some research of the SW design language if I were to improve it. Also depending on the amount of info on a character/film, some of it could be displayed in the home page, either directly or upon click expansion.
